# EmployeeFinder

This project enables a user to find an a compatable "employee" match. The app consists of a survey with 10 questions which
compares the users' answers of the employees' answers already in the database. Based off of the answers to each 
question, a match is displayed. Each user that fills out the survey is informed of their match, and their information 
is stored in the database.
